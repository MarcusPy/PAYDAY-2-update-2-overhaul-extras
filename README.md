# PAYDAY-2-update-2-overhaul-extras
None of these mods were made by me, I only took them and through a series of downgrading measurements I got them to work in 2013's version of the game.
Some features are obviously unavailable, at least without further code modification.

HopLib - dependency
KillFeed - fancy postmortem log on the side
Ultrawide Fix - made for 49:9 aspect ratio, should work for other ultrawides as well
